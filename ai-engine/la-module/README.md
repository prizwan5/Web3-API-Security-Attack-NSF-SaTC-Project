# learning-automata

The design LA chooses the activities based on the real-time learner in response to the API call. The current learning schemes and behavioral norms have been applied to single automation. However, a domain can exist where an automaton's actions elicit a vector of responses due to multiple performance criteria.

# Running

There are no special dependencies! Running `assignment.py` will output a bunch of results as well as save them to `results/Question#.csv`. The real automata code is in `vssa.py` and `fssa.py`. Assignment specific stuff is just sloppy binary searches and running simulations under multiple parameters.
